## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Styling, including the retro pixelated theme, glowing effects, and animations.
- **JavaScript**: Used for generating random fun facts from a list and displaying them in a dynamic, interactive way.
- **Google Fonts**: For the custom pixelated font (`Press Start 2P`), adding to the retro look.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash

## How It Works

1. **HTML**: The HTML file provides the structure, with a button to generate fun facts and a display area for showing them.
2. **CSS**: The CSS styles the page with a black background, neon-green text, and animated grid effects. The button and fun fact display areas are styled for a retro, glowing effect.
3. **JavaScript**: The JS code stores an array of fun facts and handles the logic of randomly selecting and displaying a fact when the user clicks the "Generate Fact" button.
